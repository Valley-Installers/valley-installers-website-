          <p className="countertop-sub-text">
            We specialize in laminate countertops. We use Wilsonart, Formica or
            Nevamar laminate giving you a wide range of selection. We also offer
            you a variety of edging, from a standard square edge to a beveled
            edge.
          </p>
          <p className="countertop-sub-text">
            With the Wilsonart HD and the Formica FX lines, your laminate
            countertops can look like traditional hardsurface tops at a fraction
            of the cost.
          </p>
          <p className="countertop-sub-text">
            There are more benefits to laminate that just the price. They are
            more bacterial and scratch resistant than hardsurface. And you have
            a greater variety of colors and patterns to choose from.
          </p>
          <p className="countertop-sub-text">
            We are also proud to introduce you to our process of installing
            undermount sink in laminate. So yes you can have an undermount sink
            with a laminate top!
